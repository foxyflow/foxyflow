- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke Fox a remote ReactJS webapp designer for small business.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... combining gamedev with webdev EG metaverses. How? WebAssembly. Traditional (C++ or C#) 3D games can now be complied to the net for instant interaction without downloading. I believe we are here thanks to smart system engineers implementing BunJS, Zig or Rust etc for web dev. I use ReactJS, React Three Fiber, Typescript, and Tailwind for the frontend; and NextJS, NodeJS, and Firebase for the backend. If you're interested, I'm interested.
- My goal is to set people up for future proof programming endeavours.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate JS programmers, 3D Modelists, and backend engineers interested in solidity's ERC1155 frameworks and non-relational databases. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... foxyflow@contractor.net -- I usually check in early mornings.
