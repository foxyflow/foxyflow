- 👋 Hi, I’m Foxyflow ... AKA Luke Fox
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Videogame development and software programming in general. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to get England's Software Human Resources Departments to notice me for a working/sponsorship visa; much harder than getting 2 degrees.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... remote or agile work with pay 20% lower than my peers.
- 📫 How to reach me ... foxyflow@contractor.net
