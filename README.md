- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke Fox a remote ReactJS webapp designer for small business.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... combining gamedev with webdev EG metaverses. How? WebAssembly. Thanks to smart system engineers implementing BunJS, Zig, or Rust etc for web dev. traditional (C++ or C#) 3D content can now be complied to the net for instant interaction without downloading. 'Javascript' has come a long way.
- I use ReactJS, React Three Fiber, Typescript, and Tailwind for the frontend; NextJS, NodeJS, and Firebase for the backend. 
- My goal is to set people up for future proof programming endeavours.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with programmers, 3D Modelists, and JS backend NEXT engineers interested in Solidity's ERC1155 frameworks and non-relational (document/JSON) databases. 
- 📫 Let's consistently build the future step by step day by day ... or just leverage and blitzscale, I won't let you down.
