- 👋 Hi, I’m Foxyflow ... AKA Luke Fox from NZ looking for graduate or junior programming work.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... programming in general and making games.
- 🌱 I’m currently ... creating a 3Dgame using C++ in Unreal to put on Steam. And making a 2Dgame using only OOP in an IDE with Python to put on Steam.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Python projects to teach people programming. I think it would be a cool business.
- 📫 How to reach me ... foxyflow@contractor.net or foxyflowware@gmail.com -- I usually check both in the early mornings.
