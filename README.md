- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke Fox, I enjoy programming in TypeScript (and JavaScript).
- 👀 I’m interested in ...  gamedev, webdev or a combination.
- I enjoy using Phaser3 for 2D Typescript games; CopperCube 6.6, PlayCanvas, and BabylonJS for 3D JS/TS games. For webapps: ReactJS and Tailwind for frontend; NextJS, NodeJS, and Firebase for the backend.
-  I also enjoy teaching programming.
- 💞️ Currently creating a 2D puzzle game using TypeScript and PhaserJS called: Down the Foxhole to instantly run on all platforms. 
- 📫 foxyflow.net to play my Mario levels made using the KaboomJS library.
