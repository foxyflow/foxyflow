- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke Fox, I enjoy programming in JavaScript.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... combining gamedev with webdev. 'Javascript' has come a long way. Therefore I'm sticking to that language for now.
- I enjoy using KaboomJS, ReactJS, React Three Fiber, threejs, Typescript, and Tailwind for the frontend; NextJS, NodeJS, and Firebase for the backend. 
-  I also enjoy teaching programming.
- 💞️  Currently creating small puzzle games using KaboomJS.
- 📫 foxyflow.net to play
