- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke Fox, when not working, I enjoy programming.
- 👀 Looking for IT, technician, or development roles.
- 💞️ Checkout TowerOfPower a 2D puzzle platformer created in Unity using C#
- Projects in the works: C SGDK retro game -- a fun way to walk away knowing how to programme; will port to SDL3 when LTS finalised;
-  and a C++ Raspberry Pico2 project when I get all the parts.
